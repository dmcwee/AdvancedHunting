# Vulnerability Queries

These are a few common KQL queries I've had customers ask about.

* **[CVE Last Seen](./CVEsLastSeen.kql)**: Reports when the CVE was last seen per device and gives an idea of when the CVE was most recently detected on that device.
* **[Most Critical CVEs](./MostCriticalCVEs.kql)**: Show the list of devices ordered by the ones with the most CVEs that have a CRITICAL value.
* **[Most CVEs](./MostCVEsAssociated.kql)**: Show the list of devies ordered by the ones with the most CVEs associated.
